            <small >
                I am a software Engineer but now I'm gonna take an initiative. I believe a businessman is a person who can buy/sell products or services in many transactions , over an extended period of time… This differentiates him from a person who may make a lot of money in few transactions, but could not repeat it consistently.Businessmen only see opportunities if life, yet they have enough discipline to know exactly when to pursue them based on experience, gut feelings, and relevant information.
